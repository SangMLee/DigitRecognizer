# DigitRecognizer

Simple Convolutional Neural Network constructed using the Keras library 
As it is a simple model with only a few layers, the model is able to complete training within a short amount of time while achieving and accuracy of approximately 98%.
Higher accuracies can be achieved by increasing the number of epochs. 
Also provides images of the validation dataset which are incorrectly predicted if enabled.
